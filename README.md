# NEAT-Unity
Library for NEAT training in .NET

This code was heavily structured on the work from InderPabla 
here https://github.com/InderPabla/NEAT/tree/master/NEAT_V2_Release

Please go and check his work as I am a huge advocate for bringing AI into more structured libraries which can then be utilized in our games and other projects.
Thanks for sharing your amazing work, keep it going!
